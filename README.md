Welcome to the repository for `RimWorld Together`! Here you will find everything related to the project, a great place for the tech savvies!

## Server Prerequisites:
Thanks to the way the server is built, there aren't any heavy hardware related dependencies, meaning that your hosting machine will only need to have an excellent network bandwith and a bit of everything else. Really, modern e-toasters could run it.

## Server Installation:
Download the latest server files at [here](https://github.com/Byte-Nova/Rimworld-Together/releases/latest). Then extract somewhere in your system and execute the executable file.
>[!WARNING]
> When extracting the server files somewhere, be mindful on where this location might be, avoid installing it at privileged locations (where admin permissions are needed) to prevent your antivirus/system kicking off.
